1. **Introduction:**
   Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project. It helps track changes to source code, documents, and other files over time. Git is widely used for its speed, flexibility, and powerful branching and merging capabilities.

2. **Version Control System (VCS) and Types of VCS:**
   Version Control System (VCS) is a software tool that helps manage changes to files and directories over time. It allows multiple users to work on the same project simultaneously, keeps track of changes, and provides version history. There are two types of VCS:
   - **Centralized VCS:** In a centralized VCS, all files and version history are stored on a central server. Developers check out files from the server, make changes, and then commit the changes back to the server.
   - **Distributed VCS:** In a distributed VCS like Git, every user has a complete copy of the repository, including the full history. Users can work independently and commit changes locally. They can also share changes with others through push and pull operations.

3. **Git Software Installation:**
   To use Git, you need to install it on your computer. Git is available for various operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can download the installer from the official Git website and follow the installation instructions for your specific operating system.

4. **Git Project Architecture:**
   Git project architecture consists of three main components:
   - **Working Directory:** The directory on your local machine where you modify and edit files.
   - **Staging Area (Index):** An intermediate area where you add files that are ready to be committed to the repository.
   - **Git Repository:** The database that stores all the version history of the project, including commits, branches, and tags.

5. **Git Commands or Operations:**
   Below is a brief explanation of commonly used Git commands:

   - **git help:** Provides help documentation for Git commands.
   - **git init:** Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.
   - **git config:** Configures Git settings like username, email, etc.
   - **git add:** Adds changes to the staging area.
   - **git status:** Shows the status of files in the working directory.
   - **git rm:** Removes files from the working directory and staging area.
   - **git restore:** Restores files from the staging area to the working directory.
   - **git commit:** Commits changes from the staging area to the repository.
   - **git log:** Displays the commit history.
   - **git clone:** Clones a remote repository to your local machine.
   - **git push:** Pushes local commits to a remote repository.
   - **git pull:** Pulls changes from a remote repository to your local machine.
   - **git branch:** Lists, creates, or deletes branches.
   - **git checkout:** Switches branches or restores files.
   - **git fetch:** Fetches changes from a remote repository without merging.
   - **git stash:** Temporarily stores changes that are not ready to be committed.
   - **git merge:** Merges changes from one branch into another.
   - **git rebase:** Applies changes from one branch on top of another.
   - **git diff:** Shows the differences between commits, branches, etc.
   - **git revert:** Reverts specific commits.
   - **git mv:** Moves or renames files and directories.

These Git commands form the core of Git's functionality and are essential for collaborating and managing version history in your projects.

**Introduction:**
Git is a popular Version Control System (VCS) that was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and is maintained by Junio Hamano. It is widely used in software development for tracking code changes, maintaining a history of files, and facilitating collaborative coding among teams.

**What is Version Control System (VCS) and types of VCS?**
A Version Control System (VCS) is a system that records changes made to a file or set of files over time. It allows developers to recall specific versions later, providing a history of changes made to the codebase. For every source code change in a file, a new version is created, enabling users to access previous states of the project easily.

**Types of Version Control Software (VCS):**
There are three types of Version Control Software:

<br/>

a. **Local VCS:**
A Local VCS is used to maintain file versions and retrieve files based on specific versions. It stores all versions of files in the same directory and tracks changes within the local machine. However, it lacks collaboration features and is not suitable for multiple developers working together.


b. **Centralized VCS:**
To address the limitations of Local VCS, the Centralized VCS was introduced. It uses a central server to store all versions of files. Developers can check out files from the central repository, work on them locally, and then commit changes back to the central server. This enables collaboration among developers and provides a centralized place for version control.

c. **Distributed VCS:**
In a Distributed VCS, each developer has a complete copy of the entire repository, including its history. This approach allows developers to work independently, even without a network connection, and provides better resilience. Additionally, there is no single point of failure, making it ideal for large and distributed teams.

**Git as a Distributed VCS:**
Git is an example of a Distributed VCS, making it highly popular among developers. It allows teams to work on the same project simultaneously and merge their changes seamlessly. Each developer has a local copy of the entire repository, enabling them to work offline and commit changes locally. These changes can later be pushed to the central repository or shared with other team members.

In summary, VCS is essential for software development as it enables version management, collaboration, and code history tracking. Git, as a distributed VCS, offers robust features that cater to the needs of modern development teams.

# **Centralized Version Control System:**

A Centralized Version Control System (CVCS) is a type of Version Control System where developers collaborate on code in a single repository, making it easier to track changes and manage code history. Examples of CVCS include SVN (Subversion), Perforce, and CVS (Concurrent Versions System).

**Working of Centralized Version Control:**

1. **Collaboration:** In a CVCS, developers can work together on a project by connecting to a central repository. They can make changes, commit them to the repository, and share their work with other team members.

2. **Central Repository:** The central repository serves as a central storage location for all versions of the codebase. It contains all the project files and their version history.

3. **Checkout and Push:** Developers use the "checkout" command to download a copy of the codebase from the central repository to their local machine. After making changes, they "push" the modified code back to the central repository.

**Advantages of Centralized Version Control:**

1. **Collaboration:** CVCS allows multiple developers to work on the same project concurrently. It provides visibility into what others are doing on the project.

2. **Control and Management:** Administrators have full control over user access and permissions. They can manage who can do what, ensuring a structured development environment.

**Disadvantages of Centralized Version Control:**

1. **Single Point of Failure:** A significant drawback of CVCS is the presence of a single central server. If this server goes down due to network traffic or hardware failure, development work can come to a halt until the server is restored.

2. **Data Loss Risk:** In case of a disk failure on the central server, without proper backups, data loss can occur. If backup practices are not diligently followed, important code changes may be lost.

**Summary:**

Centralized Version Control Systems offer collaboration and control benefits. They have been the standard VCS for many years. However, they come with the risk of a single point of failure and potential data loss if proper backup measures are not in place. The development community has gradually shifted towards Distributed Version Control Systems like Git, which offer more resilience and flexibility in development workflows.

## **Local Version Control System (LVCS) and Centralized Version Control System (CVCS):**

In both Local Version Control System (LVCS) and Centralized Version Control System (CVCS), it is not possible to access the complete history of changes made to the files. These systems only provide the latest version of the code, but not the entire history of changes.

**Explanation:**

1. **LVCS (Local Version Control System):**
   In LVCS, version control is managed on the local machine. Developers have a copy of the entire codebase on their local system, and the version control system tracks changes made to files. However, LVCS does not have a centralized repository to store the complete history of changes. As a result, developers can access only the latest version of the code they have on their local machine.

   **Example:** Suppose a file named "file.txt" has the following version history in an LVCS:
   - file.txt (Version 1.0)
   - file.txt (Version 1.1)
   - file.txt (Version 1.2)
   - file.txt (Version 1.3)

   Developers can access and view the latest version (Version 1.3) of "file.txt" on their local machine. However, they cannot access the complete history of changes (i.e., Versions 1.0 to 1.2) from the LVCS.

2. **CVCS (Centralized Version Control System):**
   In CVCS, there is a central server (repository) that stores the codebase and version history. Developers can check out the latest version from the central server and make changes locally. However, the central server does not maintain the entire history of changes for each file. When developers push their changes to the central server, they are essentially pushing the latest changes only.

   **Example:** Consider the same file "file.txt" in a CVCS with the following version history:
   - file.txt (Version 1.0)
   - file.txt (Version 1.1)
   - file.txt (Version 1.2)
   - file.txt (Version 1.3)

   Developers can retrieve the latest version (Version 1.3) of "file.txt" from the CVCS server, but they cannot access the complete history of changes (i.e., Versions 1.0 to 1.2) from the central server.

**Summary:**

Both LVCS and CVCS provide only the latest version of the code and do not maintain the complete history of changes. In contrast, Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS) like Git maintain the entire history, allowing developers to access the complete evolution of the codebase, including all versions and changes made over time.

# **Distributed Version Control System (DVCS):**

A Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) is a type of Version Control System where developers not only get the latest version of the code but also the complete history of changes made to the files. Examples of DVCS include Git, Mercurial, Darcs, and Bazaar.

**Working of Distributed Version Control:**

1. **Complete History:** In DVCS, every developer has a full copy of the repository, including the entire history of versions. This means that developers can access the complete history of changes made to the codebase, not just the latest version.

2. **Push and Snapshot:** In DVCS, when developers push their changes to the remote repository, they are not just pushing the latest snapshot of the files. Instead, they are pushing the entire changeset, which includes all the changes made since the last synchronization.

3. **Offline Work:** DVCS allows developers to work offline, as they have a local copy of the entire repository. If the main server (remote repository) goes down, developers can continue making changes locally. Once the server is back online, they can synchronize their changes with the remote repository.

**Advantages of Distributed Version Control:**

1. **Complete History:** DVCS provides a complete and detailed history of all changes made to the codebase. This level of granularity allows developers to understand the evolution of the project thoroughly.

2. **Offline Work and Resilience:** The local repository in DVCS provides resilience against server failures. Developers can continue working and making commits even when the remote server is not accessible.

**Summary:**

Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS) like Git have gained popularity due to their ability to provide a complete history of changes and support offline work. Developers have a local repository with the entire history, enabling them to work independently and collaborate seamlessly with others when the main server is back online. This decentralized approach enhances collaboration and provides a higher level of data integrity and reliability compared to Centralized Version Control Systems..
